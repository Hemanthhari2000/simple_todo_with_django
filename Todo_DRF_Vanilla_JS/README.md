# Todo_DRF_Vanilla_JS

This app is implemented with django rest framework and vanilla javascript.

### Implementation

You can just start this project like anyother Django project that is

`python manage.py runserver`

If you have not migrated the database then you can simply migrate the changes

`python manage.py makemigrations`

`python manage.py migrate`

then again run the server this should solve the issue.
